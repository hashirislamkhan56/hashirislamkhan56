👋 Hi, I’m @hashirislamkhan56

👀 I’m interested in ... coding (because who wouldn't want to wield the power of code like a wizard?)

🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, Django, Flask, C++, and C# (expanding my arsenal of programming spells)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any project that combines code, creativity, and a dash of humor

📫 How to reach me ...
